I wasn't able to download Hadoop until the day before submission, i was figuring out on the errors popping up whole time
i used all kinds of resources yet it was not possible to finish by the given time, i could complete the whole assignment if another day was given.
I had an issue while logging in to git which consumed me a lot of time while uploading files to git.
